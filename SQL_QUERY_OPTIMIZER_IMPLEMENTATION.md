# SQL Query Optimizer Implementation Summary

## Overview

A SQL query planner/optimizer has been successfully implemented in TegDB's executor to avoid unnecessary full table scans. The optimizer can detect when a SELECT query with WHERE clauses can be satisfied by direct primary key lookups instead of scanning the entire table.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Query Optimization Method**: `try_optimize_select()`
   - Analyzes WHERE clauses to detect primary key equality conditions
   - Returns optimized result if PK lookup is possible, otherwise returns None to fall back to scan

2. **Primary Key Detection**: `extract_pk_equality_conditions()`
   - Recursively analyzes WHERE conditions to find equality comparisons on all PK columns
   - Supports complex AND conditions
   - Handles composite primary keys

3. **Condition Analysis**: `collect_pk_equality_values()`
   - Traverses condition tree to collect PK column equality values
   - Works with AND conditions (collects from both sides)
   - Avoids optimization for OR conditions (would require multiple lookups)

### Optimization Logic

The optimizer works as follows:

```
SELECT query with WHERE clause
    ↓
Try to extract all PK column equality values
    ↓
All PK columns have equality conditions?
    ↓ YES                    ↓ NO
Direct PK lookup         Fall back to table scan
    ↓                        ↓
Apply remaining filters  Apply all filters during scan
    ↓                        ↓
Return optimized result  Return scan result
```

### Supported Optimizations

✅ **Optimized Queries:**
- `WHERE pk1 = value1 AND pk2 = value2` (complete PK match)
- `WHERE pk1 = value1 AND pk2 = value2 AND other_column > 10` (PK match + additional filters)
- `WHERE pk2 = value2 AND pk1 = value1` (order doesn't matter)

❌ **Not Optimized (fallback to scan):**
- `WHERE pk1 = value1` (partial PK match)
- `WHERE pk1 = value1 OR pk2 = value2` (OR conditions)
- `WHERE other_column = value` (non-PK conditions only)
- `WHERE pk1 > value1` (non-equality operators)

## Performance Results

Based on the demonstration with 300 products:

| Query Type | Execution Time | Method Used |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Complete PK equality | ~314µs | Direct PK lookup |
| Partial PK condition | ~7.4ms | Table scan |
| Non-PK condition | ~5.1ms | Table scan |
| Complex AND with PK | ~151µs | Direct PK lookup |

**Performance improvement: 20-40x faster** for optimizable queries!

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **`src/executor.rs`** - Main implementation
   - Replaced `execute_select()` with optimization logic
   - Added `try_optimize_select()` method
   - Added `extract_pk_equality_conditions()` method
   - Added `collect_pk_equality_values()` method
   - Split original logic into `execute_select_scan()` fallback method
   - Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` from `get_row_by_primary_key()`

### New Methods Added

```rust
// Try to optimize SELECT using PK lookup
fn try_optimize_select(&mut self, select: &SelectStatement, condition: &Condition) -> Result<Option<ResultSet>>

// Extract PK equality conditions from WHERE clause
fn extract_pk_equality_conditions(&self, table_name: &str, condition: &Condition) -> Result<Option<HashMap<String, SqlValue>>>

// Recursively collect PK equality values
fn collect_pk_equality_values(&self, condition: &Condition, pk_columns: &[String], pk_values: &mut HashMap<String, SqlValue>)

// Fallback to full table scan
fn execute_select_scan(&mut self, select: &SelectStatement) -> Result<ResultSet>
```

## Testing and Validation

### Demonstration Example

Created `examples/query_optimizer_demo.rs` which demonstrates:
- PK lookup optimization working correctly
- Fallback to table scan when needed
- Performance comparison between optimized and non-optimized queries
- Various WHERE clause patterns

### Test Results

- ✅ All existing tests pass (112 tests)
- ✅ No regressions in functionality
- ✅ ACID properties maintained
- ✅ IOT (Index-Organized Table) compatibility preserved
- ✅ Schema caching integration works correctly

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: 20-40x speedup for queries with complete PK conditions
2. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
3. **Automatic**: No manual hints required - optimizer decides automatically
4. **Memory Efficient**: PK lookups use constant memory vs. linear scan memory
5. **IOT Optimized**: Leverages existing IOT implementation for maximum efficiency

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the optimizer:

1. **Range Queries**: Optimize PK range conditions (`WHERE pk BETWEEN a AND b`)
2. **Prefix Scans**: Optimize partial PK matches for composite keys
3. **Query Plan Caching**: Cache optimization decisions for repeated queries
4. **Statistics**: Collect table statistics to make better optimization decisions
5. **Join Optimization**: Extend to optimize simple joins based on PK relationships

## Usage

The optimizer is completely transparent to users. Simply write SQL queries as usual:

```sql
-- This will be automatically optimized
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'electronics' AND product_id = 42;

-- This will fall back to table scan (as expected)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'electronics';
```

The executor automatically chooses the best execution strategy based on the query structure.
