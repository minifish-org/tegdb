# ðŸš€ Next Steps for Vector Search

With the foundation now in place, the next phases would be:

## Step 1: Expression Framework
- [x] Add a framework for common expressions in queries and functions
- [x] Add support for COUNT aggregate function
- [x] Add support for SUM aggregate function

## Step 2: Secondary Index Support
- [x] Add support for secondary indexes on columns
- [x] Support index creation and deletion (CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX)
- [x] Implement index codec for encoding/decoding index entries
- [x] Support index scan operations in query execution
- [x] Integrate index usage into CBO (Cost-Based Optimizer) planner
- [x] Collect and maintain index statistics for optimization
- [x] Support index usage in query planning

## Step 3: ORDER BY Support
- [x] Add support for ORDER BY clause in queries
- [x] Add support for ASC (ascending) order
- [x] Add support for DESC (descending) order

## Step 4: Vector Similarity Functions âœ…
- [x] COSINE_SIMILARITY(vec1, vec2)
- [x] EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE(vec1, vec2)
- [x] DOT_PRODUCT(vec1, vec2)
- [x] L2_NORMALIZE(vec)

## Step 5: Vector Search Operations âœ…
- [x] K-NN queries: `SELECT * FROM embeddings ORDER BY COSINE_SIMILARITY(embedding, [0.1, 0.2, ...]) DESC LIMIT 10`
- [x] Similarity thresholds: `WHERE COSINE_SIMILARITY(embedding, query_vector) > 0.8`
- [x] Range queries: `WHERE EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE(embedding, query_vector) < 0.5`

## Step 6: Vector Indexing âœ…
- [x] HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): For approximate nearest neighbor search
- [x] IVF (Inverted File Index): For clustering-based search
- [x] LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing): For high-dimensional similarity search

## Step 7: AI Integration âœ…
- [x] Embedding generation: EMBED() function with simple hash-based model
- [x] Semantic search: Text-to-vector conversion and search
- [ ] Multi-modal support: Image, audio, and text embeddings (future)
