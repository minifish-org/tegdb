# ðŸš€ Next Steps for Vector Search

With the foundation now in place, the next phases would be:

## Step 1: Expression Framework
- [ ] Add a framework for common expressions in queries and functions
- [ ] Add support for COUNT aggregate function
- [ ] Add support for SUM aggregate function

## Step 2: Secondary Index Support
- [ ] Add support for secondary indexes on columns
- [ ] Support index creation and deletion (CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX)
- [ ] Implement index codec for encoding/decoding index entries
- [ ] Support index scan operations in query execution
- [ ] Integrate index usage into CBO (Cost-Based Optimizer) planner
- [ ] Collect and maintain index statistics for optimization
- [ ] Support index usage in query planning

## Step 3: ORDER BY Support
- [ ] Add support for ORDER BY clause in queries
- [ ] Add support for ASC (ascending) order
- [ ] Add support for DESC (descending) order

## Step 4: Vector Similarity Functions
- [ ] COSINE_SIMILARITY(vec1, vec2)
- [ ] EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE(vec1, vec2)
- [ ] DOT_PRODUCT(vec1, vec2)
- [ ] L2_NORMALIZE(vec)

## Step 5: Vector Search Operations
- [ ] K-NN queries: `SELECT * FROM embeddings ORDER BY COSINE_SIMILARITY(embedding, [0.1, 0.2, ...]) DESC LIMIT 10`
- [ ] Similarity thresholds: `WHERE COSINE_SIMILARITY(embedding, query_vector) > 0.8`
- [ ] Range queries: `WHERE EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE(embedding, query_vector) < 0.5`

## Step 6: Vector Indexing
- [ ] HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): For approximate nearest neighbor search
- [ ] IVF (Inverted File Index): For clustering-based search
- [ ] LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing): For high-dimensional similarity search

## Step 7: AI Integration
- [ ] Embedding generation: Integration with embedding models
- [ ] Semantic search: Text-to-vector conversion and search
- [ ] Multi-modal support: Image, audio, and text embeddings
