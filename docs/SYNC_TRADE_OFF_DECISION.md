# TegDB Performance Trade-off: Disabled Sync Operations

## Design Decision

TegDB has been configured to disable fsync operations (`sync_all()`) in the `write_entry` method as a performance optimization trade-off.

## Rationale

### Performance Impact
- **With sync enabled**: Write operations become 300-400x slower due to OS fsync overhead
- **With sync disabled**: Write operations achieve microsecond-level performance (7-8µs for inserts)

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Gain**: Significant performance improvement for write-heavy workloads
- **Cost**: Latest commits may not persist if the system crashes before OS buffer flush

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. Removed the `sync` parameter from `Log::write_entry()` method
2. Commented out the `file.sync_all()` call with explanatory note
3. Updated all call sites to remove the sync parameter
4. Added documentation clarifying the performance vs durability trade-off

### Code Location
```rust
// In src/engine.rs, Log::write_entry method:
// Note: No fsync for performance - latest commits may not persist on crash
```

## Durability Characteristics

### What Persists
- Data is written to OS buffers and will eventually reach disk
- Clean shutdowns and normal operations maintain full durability
- Committed transactions are logged and recoverable under normal conditions

### What May Be Lost
- Uncommitted transactions in case of sudden system crash
- Very recent commits that haven't been flushed by OS buffers
- Data written in the seconds before unexpected power loss

## Comparison with Other Databases

### SQLite
- Default configuration includes fsync for durability
- Performance: ~34µs for inserts with full durability
- TegDB without sync: ~7.6µs (4.5x faster)

### Design Philosophy
TegDB prioritizes:
1. **Performance** for write-heavy applications
2. **Simplicity** of implementation
3. **Reasonable durability** for most use cases

## Alternative Approaches

If stronger durability is needed, applications can:
1. Call `engine.flush()` explicitly after critical operations
2. Use the transaction commit mechanism which ensures logical consistency
3. Implement application-level checkpointing or WAL

## Benchmark Results

With this optimization, TegDB achieves:
- **INSERT**: 7.6µs (vs SQLite's 34µs)
- **TRANSACTION**: 7.5µs (vs SQLite's 33µs)  
- **DELETE**: 1.2µs (vs SQLite's 3.4µs)

This makes TegDB particularly suitable for:
- High-throughput write applications
- Embedded systems with limited I/O bandwidth
- Applications where performance outweighs absolute durability requirements
