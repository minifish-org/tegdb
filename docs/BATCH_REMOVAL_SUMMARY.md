# Batch API Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed the batch API from the Engine and all related test cases as requested. This simplifies the transaction system and eliminates unnecessary APIs.

## Changes Made

### Engine Code Changes (`src/engine.rs`)
1. **Removed Entry struct** - The `Entry` struct that was used for batch operations
2. **Removed batch method** - The `Engine::batch()` method that performed multiple operations atomically
3. **Kept transaction system intact** - The transaction system remains fully functional with its write-through approach

### Library Exports (`src/lib.rs`)
1. **Removed Entry export** - No longer exported from both public and dev feature modules

### Test Cleanup (`tests/engine_tests.rs`)
1. **Removed Entry import** - No longer imported in test files
2. **Removed all batch-related test functions**:
   - `test_batch_operations`
   - `test_batch_mixed_operations` 
   - `test_batch_empty`
   - `test_batch_with_duplicate_keys_in_batch`
   - `test_batch_error_propagation_and_atomicity`
   - `test_persistence_after_batch`
   - `test_len_is_empty_after_batch`
   - `test_atomicity_batch_all_or_nothing`
   - `test_durability_multiple_sessions_mixed_ops`
   - `test_consistency_after_complex_operations`
   - `test_idempotency_of_batch_operations`

## What Remains
- **Transaction system** - Fully functional with write-through semantics
- **Individual engine operations** - `set()`, `get()`, `del()`, `scan()` all work as before
- **Transaction batching semantics** - Multiple operations within a transaction are still supported through multiple `set()`/`delete()` calls
- **All ACID properties** - Maintained through the transaction system
- **Crash recovery** - Still robust using only TX_COMMIT_MARKER

## Test Results
- ✅ All tests pass (`cargo test --features dev`)
- ✅ All benchmarks run successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No references to removed APIs remain

## Performance
The transaction system continues to provide:
- ~6ns overhead for transaction begin
- Write-through operations with undo logging
- Efficient crash recovery using commit markers only
- Zero-copy reads with Arc-based shared buffers

## Architecture Benefits
Removing the batch API simplifies the codebase by:
1. Eliminating duplicate functionality (batch vs transaction batching)
2. Reducing API surface area
3. Focusing on the core transaction semantics
4. Maintaining full ACID properties through transactions only

The transaction system now serves as the sole mechanism for atomic multi-operation semantics, making the API cleaner and more focused.
