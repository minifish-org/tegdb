# TegDB vs SQLite High-Level Database Benchmark Results

## Overview
This document presents performance benchmark comparisons between TegDB's high-level Database interface and SQLite's SQL interface for common database operations.

## Test Environment
- **Platform**: macOS
- **Rust Version**: Optimized release build
- **TegDB**: High-level Database API with SQL parsing
- **SQLite**: rusqlite crate with prepared statements and transactions

## Benchmark Results

### INSERT Operations
| Operation | TegDB Database | SQLite SQL | Performance Ratio |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Insert** | 2.89 ms | 1.62 µs | ~1,784x slower |
| **Transaction Insert** | 2.28 ms | 2.12 µs | ~1,075x slower |

### SELECT Operations  
| Operation | TegDB Database | SQLite SQL | Performance Ratio |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Simple Select** | 2.03 ms | 1.37 µs | ~1,482x slower |
| **Select with WHERE** | 2.00 ms | 98.6 ms | ~49x faster |

### UPDATE Operations
| Operation | TegDB Database | SQLite SQL | Performance Ratio |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Update** | 2.02 ms | 1.03 µs | ~1,961x slower |

### DELETE Operations
| Operation | TegDB Database | SQLite SQL | Performance Ratio |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Delete** | 4.24 ms | 181.1 ms | ~43x faster |

## Key Observations

### TegDB Strengths
1. **Complex Operations**: TegDB shows better performance on operations that involve scanning multiple records:
   - SELECT with WHERE clause: ~49x faster than SQLite
   - DELETE operations: ~43x faster than SQLite

2. **Consistent Performance**: TegDB shows more consistent timing across different operation types (all in the 2-4ms range)

3. **High-Level API**: Despite the performance difference, TegDB provides a clean, high-level database interface

### SQLite Strengths  
1. **Single Record Operations**: SQLite excels at point operations:
   - Simple INSERT: ~1,784x faster than TegDB
   - Simple SELECT: ~1,482x faster than TegDB  
   - UPDATE: ~1,961x faster than TegDB

2. **Optimized Storage Engine**: SQLite's mature B-tree implementation shows in single-record performance

3. **Transaction Overhead**: Lower transaction overhead for simple operations

### Performance Analysis

#### Why TegDB is Slower for Point Operations
1. **SQL Parsing Overhead**: Each SQL statement goes through a parsing phase
2. **Less Optimized Storage**: The underlying engine is less optimized than SQLite's B-tree
3. **API Layer**: Additional abstraction layers compared to SQLite's direct C interface

#### Why TegDB is Faster for Scan Operations
1. **Storage Architecture**: The underlying storage engine appears optimized for range scans
2. **Fewer Layers**: Less overhead for operations that naturally map to the storage layer
3. **Memory Layout**: Potentially better memory locality for scan operations

## Low-Level Engine Comparison

For reference, here are the low-level engine performance numbers:

### TegDB Engine (Low-Level)
- **Set**: 23.3 ns
- **Get**: 5.18 ns  
- **Scan**: 178 ns
- **Delete**: 1.89 ns

### Sled (Comparison)
- **Insert**: 79.8 ns
- **Get**: 85.0 ns
- **Scan**: 308 ns  
- **Remove**: 71.1 ns

The low-level TegDB engine shows competitive performance with other embedded databases, suggesting the performance gap is primarily in the high-level SQL interface layer.

## Recommendations

### For TegDB Development
1. **Optimize SQL Parser**: The parsing overhead is significant - consider caching parsed statements
2. **Optimize Point Operations**: Focus on single-record INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT performance  
3. **Consider Prepared Statements**: Add support for prepared statements to reduce parsing overhead
4. **Profile Storage Layer**: The scan performance advantage suggests the storage layer has potential

### For Application Use
1. **Use TegDB when**: Applications require complex queries, range scans, or bulk operations
2. **Use SQLite when**: Applications are primarily OLTP with lots of point queries
3. **Consider Hybrid**: Use both databases for different use cases within the same application

## Conclusion

TegDB shows promising performance characteristics for scan-heavy workloads and demonstrates competitive low-level storage performance. The current performance gap for point operations is primarily due to SQL parsing and high-level API overhead, which are optimization opportunities rather than fundamental architectural limitations.

The benchmark reveals that TegDB has found a different performance sweet spot compared to SQLite, potentially making it suitable for analytics and bulk operation workloads where its scan performance advantage outweighs the point operation overhead.
