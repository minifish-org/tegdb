# Fix for `cargo test --features dev` - Borrow Checker Issues

## Issue Summary

The `cargo test --features dev` command was failing due to borrow checker errors in the `drop_table_integration_test.rs` file. The errors were related to the streaming `ResultSet<'a>` implementation that ties lifetimes to the executor.

## Root Cause

The test was storing `ResultSet` instances in variables, which creates lifetime dependencies on the executor. When multiple `ResultSet` instances were held simultaneously, the borrow checker prevented further mutable borrows of the executor.

**Error Pattern:**
```rust
let begin_result = executor.begin_transaction().unwrap();  // Holds executor borrow
let create_result = executor.execute_create_table(...);   // Second mutable borrow - ERROR!
```

The `ResultSet<'a>` enum contains lifetime references that must be dropped before the executor can be borrowed again.

## Solution Applied

Fixed the borrow checker issues by ensuring `ResultSet` instances are dropped immediately after use:

### Before (Problematic):
```rust
let begin_result = executor.begin_transaction().unwrap();
assert!(matches!(begin_result, ResultSet::Begin));
// begin_result still holds executor borrow here

let create_result = executor.execute_create_table(create_statement).unwrap(); // ERROR!
```

### After (Fixed):
```rust
let begin_result = executor.begin_transaction().unwrap();
assert!(matches!(begin_result, ResultSet::Begin));
drop(begin_result); // Release the borrow explicitly

let create_result = executor.execute_create_table(create_statement).unwrap(); // OK!
assert!(matches!(create_result, ResultSet::CreateTable));
drop(create_result); // Release the borrow
```

## Alternative Patterns Used

For the final test case, used direct matching without storing in variables:
```rust
// Instead of storing result, match directly
match executor.execute_drop_table(drop_statement).unwrap() {
    ResultSet::DropTable => {
        // Table was successfully dropped
    }
    _ => panic!("Expected DropTable result"),
}
```

## Files Modified

- `tests/drop_table_integration_test.rs`: Fixed borrow checker issues by explicitly dropping `ResultSet` instances

## Test Results

✅ All 153 tests now pass with `cargo test --features dev`
✅ No compilation errors or warnings
✅ The streaming ResultSet implementation works correctly with proper lifetime management

## Key Takeaway

When working with the streaming `ResultSet<'a>` API:
- Either drop results immediately after checking them
- Or use direct pattern matching without storing in variables
- Be mindful that `ResultSet<'a>` holds lifetime references to the executor

This ensures that the borrow checker allows continued use of the executor for subsequent operations.
